📌 Overview

This project is part of the Python Developer Internship (Task 5).
The objective of the task is to analyze a CSV file using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and present meaningful insights through data visualization.

📂 Dataset

The dataset (sales_data.csv) contains information about product sales across different regions.
It includes the following columns:

Date – Date of transaction

Product – Product name (Laptop, Phone, Tablet, etc.)

Region – Region of sale (North, South, East, West)

Units_Sold – Number of units sold

Unit_Price – Price per unit

Sales – Total revenue (Units_Sold × Unit_Price)

⚡ Features

Load and explore CSV data using Pandas

Perform grouping and summarization using groupby()

Handle missing values and get dataset statistics

Filter rows based on conditions

Generate visualizations with Matplotlib:

📊 Bar Chart – Sales by Product

🥧 Pie Chart – Sales by Region

📈 Key Insights
